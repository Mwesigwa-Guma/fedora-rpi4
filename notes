Installation of Fedora on the Raspberry Pi 4:

Based on: https://pete.akeo.ie/2019/07/installing-debian-arm64-on-raspberry-pi.html

Using latest image from: https://arm.fedoraproject.org/

Using RPi4 firmware from: https://github.com/pftf/RPi4/releases/tag/v1.20

Partition microsd (using 32GB)

Now, at your shell:
# fdisk /dev/sdN
(where N is the number of the disk in /dev/)

> o (create dos partition table)
> n (new partition)
> p (primary)
> 1 (first)
> (leave blank, start at default of 2048)
> +512M (plenty of room for doing things)
(if it asks you if you want to remove a vfat signature or something, just do it. We will be formatting anyway)
> t (select partition 1)
> e (type 0e W95 FAT16 (LBA), use > L to see all if you're curious)
> a (toggle the bootable flag on partition 1
> w (write the changes to the disk)

And back at the shell:
# mkfs.vfat -F 16 /dev/sdN1 (make that VFAT partition)

Now, mount the new partition and extrat the UEFI bootloader onto it:
# mount /dev/sdN1 <mount_dir> (mount dir can be any dir)
# unzip RPi4_UEFI_Firmware_v1.20.zip -d <mount_dir>


Experimental:
Create 8G partition at the end of the disk using sector math

sector 52273152 to end on 32 GB disk with 512 bytes sectors
# sudo xzcat Fedora-Minimal-32-1.6.aarch64.raw.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdd2 bs=4M status=progress

OK so that didn't work

The upstream image works, but no USB support

Current method:
1. put UEFI firmware on SD card as described above
2. Flash Fedora aarch64 bootable iso to USB flash drive (I used fedora 32)
3. Get a spare USB flash drive on which to actually install fedora
3a. note: the installer cannot detect the SD card
3b. upstream issue: https://github.com/pftf/RPi4/issues/26
4. Boot into installation iso and install to other flash drive

kernel compilation:

kernel compilation: small tool to switch between kernels without grub


Anyway:
Fedora 32 (kernel 5.6.6) works but no ethernet, wifi, nor mouse
Fedora Rawhide (kernel 5.8.0) works, something to do with bcmgenet

The patch(es):

Issues:
No SD card support in Linux (current support is in device tree)
No GPIO support in Linux (current support is in device tree)

genet networking support:

Here is where the ACPI support for rpi4 genet driver is added:
